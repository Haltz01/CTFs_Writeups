# CTFs_Writeups
Write-ups of CTF challegens that I've worked on - mainly with Ganesh, an information security study group from University of Sao Paulo. More writeups and info about the group can be found [here (Github)](https://github.com/GANESH-ICMC), [here (website)](http://ganesh.icmc.usp.br/) or [here (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/ganeshICMC/).
