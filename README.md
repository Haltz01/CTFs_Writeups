# CTFs_Writeups
Write-ups of CTF challegens that I've worked on - mainly with Ganesh, an information security study group from University of Sao Paulo. More writeups and info about the group can be found [here (Github)](https://github.com/GANESH-ICMC), [here (website)](http://ganesh.icmc.usp.br/) or [here (Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/ganeshICMC/).

### List of CTFs
- Pwn2Win 2019
- Websec.fr 
- Fireshell CTF 2020
- Security Cast 2020
- Hackaflag 2020
- TetCTF 2021

The write-ups are organized in folders following this pattern: `/year_ctfName_ChallengeName` or `/year_ctfName/challName`

## TO-DO:
- Organize CTFs that alreary are in the repo (improve a lot of writeups...)
- Add Writeups from CTFs that are in the local machine + in Ganesh's server
